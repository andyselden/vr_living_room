# vr_living_room

This is a simple application showing a living room in vr through the Google Cardboard project.  It allows you to look around a living room and click to navigate.  

Uses Viro Media and React Native.  Setup instructions here: https://docs.viromedia.com/docs/quick-start (the only difference is that you will see a living room instead of hello world)
